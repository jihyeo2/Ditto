YOU MUST READ CAREFULLY BELOW!!
* You should remove <Fill in> and add your own input. Example is shown below the schema.
* Image is currently omitted as it cannot be saved properly. Julie will resolve the issue today.
* The name "location" is just how it is saved in backend. UI will display it as "address".
* Only specified parameters are numbers. For the rest, type a string. 
* For Menu_Schema, look at number 3. Menu below Store Schema.
* For anyone wondering what hiride and facedrive is, they are the one hosting this Hackathon.
* Side note: Now that I'd written an example, it is irritably taking quite a time. Good Luck, folks.
*** You must follow the given schema unless you want to make Julie sleep-deprived. Just letting you know, I'm already on my third...juice, not coffee.***
