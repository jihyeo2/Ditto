Name: Smart Senior Seller
  
Background/ Motives: After the outbreak, digital lag that has existed among senior citizens has signigicantly noticed due to the limitation of outdoor facilities. To help especially the elderly sellers, we have created a helper app that connects them with volunteers who would post basic information and further ads of their stores. Such volunteers are students who are seeking volunteering credits required during school years or anyone who are willing to help the seniors. This would serve as an alternative place to volunteer for those who have had hard time finding one offline due to COVID-19.
