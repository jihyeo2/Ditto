2. Modify StoreAdd pg1 to save its data when returned from pg2  
3. Change profileImage optional 
4. EditMenu --> add edit feature & button?
5. AccountScreen: change to NewPassword & check NewPassword 

Frontend only

1. "search items" in the middle of the search bar
2. Enable multiline for InfoSub
